## UDP
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a network protocol.
- It is considered an unreliable protocol compared to TCP, as it doe not provided guaranteed that the packets are delivered. If a packet was lost due to a network issue, then the data is lost forever.
- Connnectionless.

### UDP Socket in Python
In pythonâ€™s socket, we need to initalise a type of communication. For UDP we use the `socket.SOCK_DGRAM`

UDP is a socket that
```py
import socket

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.sendto(message.encode(), (SERVER_NAME, SERVER_PORT))

sock.settimeout(6)
try:
    msg, addr = client.recvfrom(2048)
    # There was a response
    # ...
except socket.error:
    # There was no response after 6 seconds
    # ...
```
