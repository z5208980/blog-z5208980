## Introduction
As part of security awareness in the workplace, my workplace required us to finish and training of security when working from home. So these were just notes I written down.

### Internet Security when you work from home
Working from home has become increasingly common, especially in recent times. However, it's crucial to prioritize internet security to protect sensitive information and maintain a safe work environment. Here are some key points to consider:

1. Start preparing to work from home as soon as possible:
 - Identify the technology you will need, including devices, printers, and a stable internet connection.
 - Determine the necessary software and ensure it is properly installed, including any special software required. Consider using cloud-based solutions for added convenience.
2. Identify and secure your physical workspace:
 - Choose a workspace with minimal security risks, such as a private room or dedicated office space.
 - Keep your workspace clean and organized, ensuring that sensitive documents are properly stored and disposed of securely.
3. Keep your work and personal life separate:
 - Avoid using personal devices for work purposes whenever possible.
 - Maintain separate user accounts and profiles for work-related activities.
4. Make sure your devices are secure:
 - Use strong and unique passwords or passphrases for all your devices and accounts.
 - Enable device lock screens and automatic locking after periods of inactivity.
 - Regularly update your devices with the latest security patches and firmware updates.
5. Ensure your internet connection is secure:
 - Enable security settings, such as firewalls and encryption, on your home network router.
 - Whenever possible, use a wired internet connection instead of relying solely on Wi-Fi.
 - Utilize a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to create a secure connection when accessing sensitive information or connecting to your organization's network remotely.
 - Consider enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) for an additional layer of security.
6. Always be cautious of hackers' tricks:
 - Exercise caution when using social media platforms and be suspicious of unsolicited messages or friend requests.
 - Be wary of phishing attempts, where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations to trick you into revealing sensitive information. Check email addresses, avoid clicking on suspicious links or opening suspicious attachments, and verify the authenticity of the sender.
 - Stay alert for spear phishing attacks, which use personalized information to deceive individuals.
 - Remember to "Stop, Look, and Think" before taking any actions that involve sensitive information or financial transactions.
7. Stay secure when working remotely from public places:
 - Exercise caution when using public Wi-Fi networks, as they may not be secure. Consider using a VPN to encrypt your connection.
 - Keep confidential information private and be mindful of your surroundings.
 - Verify the legitimacy of Wi-Fi networks before connecting to them.
8. Familiarize yourself with your organization's policies and procedures regarding internet security and remote work.

### Security Awareness Training

#### Social Engineering
Social engineering refers to the tactics used by attackers to manipulate individuals and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. Here are some red flags to watch out for:

- Social media is a common platform for impersonation, where attackers pose as celebrities or trusted individuals.
- Phishing involves sending deceptive emails that trick recipients into opening suspicious links or providing personal information. Be cautious of unknown senders, emails received outside of business hours, emotionally charged content, and carefully inspect links and attachments.
- Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing that utilizes mined personal data to deceive victims.
- Pretexting involves creating a false scenario to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.
- Quid pro quo attacks offer something in exchange for information.
- Insider threats can come from employees who misuse their privileges or seek revenge by engaging in unauthorized activities.
- These social engineering techniques can result in theft, production loss, and reputational damage.

Your role in internet security includes understanding the threat landscape and being aware of various social engineering tactics. Key points to consider include:

- Phishing attacks are prevalent, so be suspicious of every email, practice "Stop, Look, and Think" before taking any actions, and verify the authenticity of emails by contacting the sender through a trusted source.
- Smishing refers to phishing attacks conducted through text messages, so be cautious when providing sensitive information via SMS.
- Disinformation campaigns aim to deceive and mislead individuals, so it's important to verify and fact-check information before taking any actions.
- Ransomware can infect devices and hold data hostage, often demanding a ransom for its release. Be vigilant about opening unknown attachments or downloading suspicious files.
- Spyware can monitor your activities and gather sensitive information, particularly on mobile devices. Be cautious when downloading software and only install applications from trusted sources.
- Malicious apps may contain harmful programs that compromise your device's security. Exercise caution and review the permissions requested by apps before installation.
- When browsing websites, pay attention to the URL. Ensure it is spelled correctly and look for the secure connection indicator (https://). Be wary of domain variations or misspellings that could indicate phishing attempts.
- Public Wi-Fi networks are not secure, so avoid connecting to them without a VPN.
- Be alert for tailgating attempts, where unauthorized individuals attempt to gain physical access to your workspace or devices.
- Avoid picking up or plugging in unknown flash drives, as they may contain malware.
- Voice phishing (vishing) involves attackers attempting to extract sensitive information over phone calls. Be cautious when providing personal or financial details over the phone.

By understanding these social engineering tactics and implementing appropriate security measures, you can better protect yourself and your sensitive information while working from home.
