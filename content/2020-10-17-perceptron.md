## Perceptions
Basically, perceptrons is a **one**-layer neural network (multi-layer is a neural network). The most simple perceptrons are **linear separable**. They are **binary classifiers**, meaning that they will have two outputs. Hence their activation function is **step activation**.

`x_i` inputs `w_0` bias weight. If it is positive then its more likely to fire, rather than negative.

Linear Separably,

- Learning Rate (Î· eta)
    - parameter that controls the amount of change needed on the model.

### Motivation
**epochs** a number of times the model trains a dataset. Eg. 10 epochs = 10 training.
*Simple* Perceptions uses **Linear Seperable algorithm**.
