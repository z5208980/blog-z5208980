## NEAR Frontend Simplified

### Literature Review

It seems on the **NEAR protocol**, and *accountId* can only be mapped to **0 or 1** contract. The name for the account is the **contract address**. Hence in order to deploy multiple contracts or things. We can either implement,
- Smart contract that utilises a struct and manage all logic, storage on one smart contract,
- For every smart contract needed, create a **sub account** using the following command, `near create-account sub.account.near --masterAccount account.near` and then deploy the contract on the `sub.account.near`.
	- **Note:** Since there are no faucets. When requiring more *NEAR* tokens, create a new testnet account and send to master account.
 
### Set up
To use `near-api-js` simply add the **cdn** in the *head* tag.
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/nearprotocol/near-api-js/dist/near-api-js.js"></script>
```

or in my case using *npm*,
```bash
npm i near-api-js
```

### Deploying contract using `near-api-js`

From the near documentation, you can use the `near-cli` to deploy a smart contract via,
```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```
To build the `.wasm` file used for deployment and 
```bash
near deploy --wasmFile target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/non_fungible_token.wasm --accountId ACCOUNT.NEAR
```
To actually deploy the *bytecode* to NEAR.

But for the frontend, we have to use the `near-api-js`, hence we from the documentation, this little snippet,
```js
const near =  await  connect(config);  
const account =  await near.account("accountId");  
const response =  await account.deployContract(fs.readFileSync('./wasm_files/status_message.wasm'));  
console.log(response);
```
allows us to set out account from our login *wallet* and simply deploy a contract from that **account**. It seems that it

Usually, when there is a `requestSignIn` a **contract** is passed to allow access and methods called that require **transaction**. By this I assume methods calls that require **gas** or is **payable** in Ethereum terms. However, if we want to load in a seperate contract, we must use, `nearAPI.Contract()` where the nearAPI was *imported*.

### Invoking Contract methods
Typically `near-cli`, invoking a contract methods, requires the command,
```bash
near call CONTRACT.NEAR '{"arg": "value"}' --accountId ACCOUNT.NEAR
```

For getter **view** functions,
```bash
near view CONTRACT.NEAR '{"arg": "value"}' --accountId ACCOUNT.NEAR
```

To do so with `near-api-js`, we first need to **load** a contract
```js
const  contract = new  nearAPI.Contract(
	wallet.account(),
	"greeter.rafaam.testnet", 
	{
		viewMethods: [String]
		changeMethods: [String],
		sender: wallet.account(),
	}
);
```

then to be able to call a method,
```js
await  contract.get_greeting( { args:  "value", } )
```
