## Everything about DAO

**D**ecentralized **A**utonomous **O**rganization (abbrev. as DAO). What a DAO is, is a group of people or *organisation* that pursuing a shared goal . This inheritly create transparency, and efficient as the goals and values of the DAO are decentralised and no single entity has control over the DAO. As in blockchain this is because the DAO would be dictated by smart contracts rather than using a hierarchical structures of order.

## Technicality of a DAO

A DAO often requires,
### Community 
This can be as simple as friends, like mind individuals, developers to more formal entities like investors.

Engagement on a DAO, can be done via 
- airdrop of the DAO token

but it doesn't neccessary require on-chain solution. Medium such as access to **Discord** or communication on **Telegram** can be a way to grow as a community.

### Blockchain
This can be a simple as creating on Etheruem where a set of smart contracts will be our DAO and run the ecosystem. Basically any blockchain that support smart contracts such as Cardano, Cosmos or EOS.

With blockchain in mind, hence a **wallet** will also be an important piece to creating a DAO as this will be the address that stores the smart contracts, and effectively goveranced by the people of the DAO.

### Infrastructure
The main application of DAO can be access via any type of device, whether it is a,
- web browser
- desktop application
- mobile

As our smart contracts are deploy on a blockchain, the best technology to access the DAO via the frontend application can be done, via using **web3** or api that support connection to the blockchain.

### Token
Tokenisation of a DAO is important because it give rise for members of the DAO **governance** and ability to make decision on behalf of the DAO. Again using Ethereum to build a DAO platform, a `ERC-20` token can be deploy as part of the DAO in order to provide transparency in the transactions, and voting rights on key decisions  within the. 

Typically participation and join the DAO can occurs via.
- Obtaining `ETH`
- Swapping `ETH` to the `DAO-TOKEN` 

Depending on the DAO, the token can not benefits the members but itself.
- **Bounties** - rewards for completing task or fixing issue within ecosystem
- **Salaries** - incentive to support core team
